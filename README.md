# EE449_ComputationalIntelligence
Projects to create Neural Networks to compute given tasks, written in Python

--- Project 1 ---

In this homework, you will perform experiments on artificial neural network (ANN) training and draw
conclusions from the experimental results. You will train multi layer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional
neural network (CNN) classifiers on a subset of Fashion-MNIST dataset [1]. The implementations will be
in Python language and you will be using PyTorch [2]. You can visit the link provided in the reference [2]
to understand the usage of the library.

In this homework, you will perform experiments on evolutionary algorithm and draw conclusions from
the experimental results. The task is to create an image made of filled circles, visually similar to a given
RGB source image (painting.png).
The implementations will be in Python language and you will be using OpenCV package to draw the
images. You can install it using conda install opencv command. You can use import cv2 to use it
in your code.

In the scope of this homework, your task is simply to implement a fuzzy controller which takes two input
measurements and provides one output control (Fig. 1) to quickly vaccinate the 60% of the people and
maintain that percentage. You will practice on set partitioning and fuzzy control rules to determine your
own partitions and decision logic. The details on the sets where the measurements and output control
lie will be provided in the next section.
The homework is composed of 2 parts. In the first part you are to design your controller without using
effective vaccination rate measurements. In the second part, you will update your design to take effective
vaccination rate measurements into account. In both parts, you will estimate some performance metrics
and you will provide the results by some visuals. Finally, you will compare the two controllers and
interpret the results by your own conclusions.
